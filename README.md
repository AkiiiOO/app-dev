# My Favorite Movie is **"Spirited Away"**
*Spirited Away centers on 10 year-old Chihiro who inadvertently ends up in a world of gods and monsters while moving to a new neighborhood with her parents. Chihiro ends up stranded in this netherworld after her parents get transformed into pigs and the river floods. Chihiro must learn to navigate the spirit world and how to escape before she forgets her name and is trapped forever*
That is a fun, sad adventure! :joy:
*This is the first studio ghibli movie i watch which make it one of my favorite movie*
[You can watch it on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/ph-en/title/60023642)
